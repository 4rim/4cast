# 4cast

4cast is a work-in-progress TUI weather app written in C and zsh script, held
together by duct tape and sheer will. It uses tools such as `curl` and the
ncurses library to retrieve data various free weather API services, and to
display it as a forecast on your console. 

This program is inspired by [wego](https://github.com/schachmat/wego) and its
amazing command-line service, [wttr.in](https://github.com/chubin/wttr.in). I
highly recommend checking them out.
